Hello PMCB family,

<h3>A. REALITY CHECK AS ON DATE :</h3>
<ol>
<li>No Entity in sight for merger.</li>
<li>No fund infusion or aid by any govt/no help from political parties.</li>
<li>Only informal intimation by RBI appointed Administrator about Interest free loan from DICGC for revival plan around 4500 CR.</li>
<li>RBI 35A extension letter commits in writing of bank revival exclusively.</li>
<li>Administrator informally admits of sending revival plan to RBI.(plan Details unknown).</li>
<li>Response from RBI on revival awaited.</li>
<li>Practical revival calculations as per known sources makes Bail in option by Equity & Bond conversion unavoidable to restart the Bank.(conversion % not known) </li>
<li>Revival does not mean closure of all other options like merger etc.later on.(In fact a pre-step to merger).</li>
</ol>
<h3>B. OUR PLANS PROPOSED :</h3>
<ol>
<li>Study the merits of the revival plan as & when made available to us by RBI.</li>
<li>React on the same with mutual consent of PMC victims subsequently.</li>
<li>In the meanwhile Importantly gather the data base in advance of all the bank customers in small whatsapp or telegram groups who are ready to start the bank by accepting the Bail in revival option anticipated from RBI in due course.</li>
<li>Reason for this data base collection of like minded bank customers is to speed up the revival process by quickly approaching such groups for updating on revival plans & obtaining their written consents if required later on without waste of time as RBI may give only limited time for raising objections.</li>
<li>At this moment we are not planning to give any counter revival plans to RBI. (WAIT AND WATCH FOR RBI PLAN)</li>
</ol>
<h3>C. ACTIONS NOW :</h3>
<ol>
<li>If you agree to above said process, please join the whatsapp group using the given link or join the telegram group by using link ( Either of them ).</li>

<li>Do not forward the link to anyone else as this groups users are predefined. (To avoid duplication).</li>
</ol>
<p><b>CAUTION:</b> ONE WRONG STEP BY US WILL PUSH BANK INTO LIQUIDATION AND WILL MAKE US BIG LOSERS. <p>
